# Users by Date Registered

This simple plugin allows you to filter your users by date registered. A new column also displays the date the user registered on your site.

### Plugin Support
If you need support then please use the WordPress.org forums for [community support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/users-by-date-registered). If you spot a bug, you can of course log it on this [repository](https://github.com/seb86/Users-by-Date-Registered/issues) instead where I can act upon it more efficiently.

### Support SÃ©bastien's Open Source Projects!
If you'd like me to keep producing free and open source software or if you use this plugin and find it useful then please consider [paying for an hour](https://www.paypal.me/CodeBreaker/100eur) of my time. I'll spend two hours on open source for each contribution.
